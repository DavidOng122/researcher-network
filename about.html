                    <h3>Clinical Trials:</h3>
                    <p>Our team actively engages in clinical trials to assess and implement the latest advancements in surgical procedures, technologies, and treatment modalities, aiming to introduce evidence-based practices that elevate the standard of surgical care and ensure optimal patient outcomes. Our research spans diverse themes, including perioperative optimization of bariatric outcomes, predictors of bariatric surgery outcomes, Indigenous bariatric surgery, and acute care surgery outcomes. We explore areas such as fitness and nutritional outcomes, geography/access to care, family physician experience, sleep apnea, and virtual care in the context of bariatric surgery. Our commitment extends to predicting factors like length of stay, bariatric biomarker profiles, and considering the influence of geography and Indigenous status. Additionally, we conduct foundational work to understand the Indigenous experience with bariatric surgery, aiming to incorporate Indigenous approaches to wellness in bariatric care. Our research themes align with interests in bariatric surgery, minimally invasive surgery, and acute care surgery, all contributing to advancements in surgical knowledge and patient care.</p>
